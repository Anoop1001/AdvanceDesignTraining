Software Engineering(Managing Complexity) VS Software development(Future scalability)

Design(Behavior low level) vs Architecture(High Level structure)

Design Quality
-maintainability
-reusability
-changeability
-understandability
-flexibility
-extensibility

Design Quality impacts software Quality and indicated technical debt.


Architecture Quality
- Costlier than design error

Technical Debt
--Currently working but improve further

OOP (polymorphism and inheritance are language specific)
-Abstraction
-Encapsulation
-Modularization (Grouping abstractions)
-Hierrachy (Ordering Abstractions)

PHAME for OOP Concepts - In his object model, Grady Booch mentions Abstraction, Encapsulation, Modularisation, and Hierarchy as fundamental software design principles.[4] The acronym PHAME (Principles of Hierarchy, Abstraction, Modularisation, and Encapsulation) is sometimes used to refer to these four fundamental principles.[5]
