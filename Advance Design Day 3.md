Improved manageability and supportability.

Enforces good design principles.

#### SOCK model

Simplicity,

Observbility,

Controllability,

Knowledge of Expected Results

What makes Testing difficult?

Dense dependencies -- Test Doubles to resolve - SEAM - is a place where you modify the behaviorwithout editing the place!
"new" Operator
Heavy constructor

Use Dependency Injection

Constructor initialization should be only for the members
Extract interface, Dependency injection, Dependency lookup, Constructor overloading

Law of demeter violation
